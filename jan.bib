		  great flexibility for building parallel and distributed
		  applications composed of independent processes. However,
		  the shared space model does not provide protection against
		  untrustworthy processes. Linda processes communicate by
		  reading and writing messages in a globally visible data
		  space, so a malicious process can launch any number of
		  security attacks. This paper presents the design of a new
		  coordination model which extends Linda with fine-grained
		  access control. The semantics of the model is presented in
		  the context of a process calculus. A prototype of our
		  model, called SecOS, has been implemented in Java",

		  coverage of methods of spatial data analysis ranges from
		  standard techniques to new developments, and the examples

		  literature. All the examples can be run using R contributed
		  packages available from the CRAN website, with code and

  abstract	= {Quantifying shape and size variation is essential in
		  evolutionary biology and in many other disciplines. Since
		  the ``morphometric revolution of the 90s,'' an increasing
		  number of publications in applied and theoretical
		  morphometrics emerged in the new discipline of statistical
		  shape analysis. The R language and environment offers a
		  single platform to perform a multitude of analyses from the
		  acquisition of data to the production of static and
		  interactive graphs. This offers an ideal environment to
		  analyze shape variation and shape change. This open-source
		  language is accessible for novices and for experienced
		  users. Adopting R gives the user and developer several
		  advantages for performing morphometrics: evolvability,
		  adaptability, interactivity, a single and comprehensive
		  platform, possibility of interfacing with other languages
		  and software, custom analyses, and graphs. The book
		  explains how to use R for morphometrics and provides a
		  series of examples of codes and displays covering
		  approaches ranging from traditional morphometrics to modern
		  statistical shape analysis such as the analysis of landmark
		  data, Thin Plate Splines, and Fourier analysis of outlines.
		  The book fills two gaps: the gap between theoreticians and
		  students by providing worked examples from the acquisition
		  of data to analyses and hypothesis testing, and the gap
		  between user and developers by providing and explaining
		  codes for performing all the steps necessary for
		  morphometrics rather than providing a manual for a given
		  software or package. Students and scientists interested in
		  shape analysis can use the book as a reference for
		  performing applied morphometrics, while prospective
		  researchers will learn how to implement algorithms or
		  interfacing R for new methods. In addition, adopting the R
		  philosophy will enhance exchanges within and outside the
		  morphometrics community. Julien Claude is evolutionary
		  biologist and palaeontologist at the University of
		  Montpellier 2 where he got his Ph.D. in 2003. He works on
		  biodiversity and phenotypic evolution of a variety of
		  organisms, especially vertebrates. He teaches evolutionary
		  biology and biostatistics to undergraduate and graduate
		  students and has developed several functions in R for the

  abstract	= {Wavelet methods have recently undergone a rapid period of
		  development with important implications for a number of
		  disciplines including statistics. This book fulfils three
		  purposes. First, it is a gentle introduction to wavelets
		  and their uses in statistics. Second, it acts as a quick
		  and broad reference to many recent developments in the
		  area. The book concentrates on describing the essential
		  elements and provides comprehensive source material
		  references. Third, the book intersperses R code that
		  explains and demonstrates both wavelet and statistical
		  methods. The code permits the user to learn the methods, to
		  carry out their own analyses and further develop their own
		  methods. The book is designed to be read in conjunction
		  with WaveThresh4, the freeware R package for wavelets. The
		  book introduces the wavelet transform by starting with the
		  simple Haar wavelet transform and then builds to consider
		  more general wavelets such as the Daubechies compactly
		  supported series. The book then describes the evolution of
		  wavelets in the directions of complex-valued wavelets,
		  non-decimated transforms, multiple wavelets and wavelet
		  packets as well as giving consideration to boundary
		  conditions initialization. Later chapters explain the role
		  of wavelets in nonparametric regression problems via a
		  variety of techniques including thresholding,
		  cross-validation, SURE, false-discovery rate and recent
		  Bayesian methods, and also consider how to deal with
		  correlated and non-Gaussian noise structures. The book also
		  looks at how nondecimated and packet transforms can improve
		  performance. The penultimate chapter considers the role of
		  wavelets in both stationary and non-stationary time series
		  analysis. The final chapter describes recent work
		  concerning the role of wavelets for variance stabilization
		  for non-Gaussian intensity estimation. The book is aimed at
		  final year undergraduate and Masters students in a numerate
		  discipline (such as mathematics, statistics, physics,
		  economics and engineering) and would also suit as a quick
		  reference for postgraduate or research level activity. The
		  book would be ideal for a researcher to learn about
		  wavelets, to learn how to use wavelet software and then to
		  adapt the ideas for their own purposes.},

  abstract	= {A Modern Approach to Regression with R focuses on tools
		  and techniques for building regression models using
		  real-world data and assessing their validity. When
		  weaknesses in the model are identified, the next step is to
		  address each of these weaknesses. A key theme throughout
		  the book is that it makes sense to base inferences or
		  conclusions only on valid models. The regression output and
		  plots that appear throughout the book have been generated
		  using R. On the book website you will find the R code used
		  in each example in the text. You will also find SAS code
		  and STATA code to produce the equivalent output on the book
		  website. Primers containing expanded explanations of R, SAS
		  and STATA and their use in this book are also available on
		  the book website. The book contains a number of new real
		  data sets from applications ranging from rating
		  restaurants, rating wines, predicting newspaper circulation
		  and magazine revenue, comparing the performance of NFL
		  kickers, and comparing finalists in the Miss America
		  pageant across states. One of the aspects of the book that
		  sets it apart from many other regression books is that
		  complete details are provided for each example. The book is
		  aimed at first year graduate students in statistics and
		  could also be used for a senior undergraduate class.},

  abstract	= {Since its inception, R has become one of the preeminent
		  programs for statistical computing and data analysis. The
		  ready availability of the program, along with a wide
		  variety of packages and the supportive R community make R
		  an excellent choice for almost any kind of computing task
		  related to statistics. However, many users, especially
		  those with experience in other languages, do not take
		  advantage of the full power of R. Because of the nature of
		  R, solutions that make sense in other languages may not be
		  very efficient in R. This book presents a wide array of
		  methods applicable for reading data into R, and efficiently
		  manipulating that data. In addition to the built-in
		  functions, a number of readily available packages from CRAN
		  (the Comprehensive R Archive Network) are also covered. All
		  of the methods presented take advantage of the core
		  features of R: vectorization, efficient use of
		  subscripting, and the proper use of the varied functions in
		  R that are provided for common data management tasks. Most
		  experienced R users discover that, especially when working
		  with large data sets, it may be helpful to use other
		  programs, notably databases, in conjunction with R.
		  Accordingly, the use of databases in R is covered in
		  detail, along with methods for extracting data from
		  spreadsheets and datasets created by other programs.
		  Character manipulation, while sometimes overlooked within
		  R, is also covered in detail, allowing problems that are
		  traditionally solved by scripting languages to be carried
		  out entirely within R. For users with experience in other
		  languages, guidelines for the effective use of programming
		  constructs like loops are provided. Since many statistical
		  modeling and graphics functions need their data presented
		  in a data frame, techniques for converting the output of
		  commonly used functions to data frames are provided
		  throughout the book. Using a variety of examples based on
		  data sets included with R, along with easily simulated data
		  sets, the book is recommended to anyone using R who wishes
		  to advance from simple examples to practical real-life data
		  manipulation solutions.},

		  Focusing on the practicality of the methods and the

		  mobile computation. Threads and resources are tree
		  structured; the nodes thereof correspond to agents, the
		  units of mobility. The Calculus extends a pi-calculus core
		  with synchronous, objective mobility of agents over
		  channels. This paper systematically compares all previous
		  variants of Seal Calculus. We study their operational
		  behaviour with labelled transition systems and
		  bisimulations; by comparing the resulting algebraic
		  theories we highlight the differences between these
		  apparently similar approaches. This leads us to identify
		  the dialect of Seal that is most amenable to operational
		  reasoning and can form the basis of a distributed
		  programming language. We propose type systems for
		  characterising the communications in which an agent can
		  engage. The type systems thus enforce a discipline of agent
		  mobility, since the latter is coded in terms of
		  higher-order communication.",

  abstract	= "A transaction defines a locus of computation that
		  satisfies important concurrency and failure properties.
		  These so-called ACID properties provide strong
		  serialization guarantees that allow us to reason about
		  concurrent and distributed programs in terms of
		  higher-level units of computation (e.g., transactions)
		  rather than lower-level data structures (e.g.,
		  mutual-exclusion locks). This paper presents a framework
		  for specifying the semantics of a transactional facility
		  integrated within a host programming language. The TFJ
		  calculus, an object calculus derived from Featherweight
		  Java, supports nested and multi-threaded transactions. We
		  give a semantics to TFJ that is parametrized by the
		  definition of the transactional mechanism that permits the
		  study of different transaction models. We give two
		  instantiations: one that defines transactions in terms of a
		  versioning-based optimistic concurrency model, and the
		  other which specifies transactions in terms of a
		  pessimistic two-phase locking protocol, and present
		  soundness and serializability properties for our
		  semantics.",
